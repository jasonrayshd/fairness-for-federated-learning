This repo provides different ways of sampling original dataset of MNIST and CIFAR10
You can use:
(1) gaussian sampling
(2) long tail sampling
(3) random sampling: randomly sample images
(4) customized sampling: provide your own version of weights for sampling each category
(5) equal sampling: equal number of images in each category

by spcifying argument --mode (gaussian, tail, random, equal, fixed_gaussian, fixed_sharp_gaussian, fixed_tail)


and to split the sampled dataset into client number of datasets, you should specify argument by:
--split_mode (random, equal_num, equal_per_class)

(1) random: randomly split sampled dataset
(2) equal_num: equally split sampled dataset to ensure equal number of dataset on every client device
(3) equal_per_class: equally split each category in sampled dataset to ensure equal number of each class on every client device


To train a model:
python train.py --name "your model's name e.g. 0406_random_random1" --mode "your mode" --split_mode "your split_mode" --dataset (MNIST,cifar10) --epochs "epochs"

parameters of model will be saved in the directory ./checkpoints, make sure to create it

To test a model:
python test.py --name "name of model requires testing"
you can specify dataset which by default is MNIST
